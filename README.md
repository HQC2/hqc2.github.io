To deploy the website locally, you will need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed.
If you don't have Jekyll installed, you can find installation instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```shell
bundle install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can launch the webpage by running the following command:

```shell
make serve
```

After launching the webpage, you can access it in your browser by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:4000/.
